## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The application was an inventory app that allows users to create an inventory list that can be added to and updated. It addressed the need for a inuitve way to keep track of an inventory of items from a mobile device.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens needed are the screen to display the list of items, allow users to add new items, edit existing items, and remove existing items. It also needed to allow users to login and create an account. My design is easy to navigate with a scrollable list. It also has a button in the corner for adding new items. 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I initally started out by prototyping and working on one feature at a time, testing while I worked. Near the end, I started jumping around all over the project and testing less frequently. In the future I will stick to my inital approach and I will also be planning the order that I implement features. It's better to have less code with all of it working than more code with most of it broken.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my code by checking for the expected output and debugging. While debugging, I would set break points so that I could see the values of the variables and check that they were as expected. This revealed a few times that I did not get values from inputs correctly. Testing is important because if you dont test often, it will be hard to figure out why your code doesn't work.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I really had to overcome challenges when implementing the recycler view list. There were many componenets necessary to get it to work as expected and it took looking at several resources to get it to work as expected.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The best componenet of my application was the list view. The features I was able to implement all work as expected. I was able to create a scrollable view that updates when a new item is added to the list. When the app is closed and then opened again, the list still has all the items including the ones users add.
